# Asterisk SMS Suite

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide a set of tools for processing and
controlling the flow of short messages of different types in the
Asterisk PBX.  
This suite can correctly route SMS-es and SIP instant messages and also
resend them as a fax or voice messages to the non-messaging channels
making it a ready-to-use solution for instant messaging of any kind.

## Important notes

This set of tools was originally created for SIP-configured Asterisk
working on Linux system (especially Debian).
Now it was converted to work with PJSIP configurations
**dropping SIP support!**

Default configuration values (provided in the `smsSuiteConfig.py` file)
assume that Asterisk and its directories are located in their default
locations (`/etc/asterisk`, `/var/spool/asterisk`, etc.) and that there
is a dedicated directory for all scripts at `/etc/asterisk/scripts`.

**This solution was created for Asterisk 16.28.**  
However it should work with the newer versions. I haven't tested if
these tools can work properly on systems other than Linux.

## Differences between SMS technology and SIP messaging

As far as I have seen, people often confuse SMS technology with SIP
instant messaging. **They are completely different protocols!**

SMS requires some kind of an explicit central point (also called SMS
Centre/SMS Centrum) which acts like a server which receive, store,
process and resend messages (and, ideally, should keep them for some
time if the receiving end is offline).

SIP messaging is much more automated and then looks more like
a point-to-point service as it doesn't explicitly use such a thing like
SMS Centre (**but Asterisk still has to do processing internally**).
However, this technology is definitely less powerful than classic SMS
service.

And, the most important thing - SMS Centre actually **can** work even on
the classic landline telephony (POTS) using FSK modulation (which is, in
my opinion, such a great thing that it really works in Asterisk!)
allowing You to use an old analogue phone with SMS support with it.
In contrast, **SIP messages can't** as they are protocol based. I know
no VoIP ATA that could turn this into the FSK SMS or something similar.
There are probably IP phones supporting SIP messaging, but I don't know
of any. The only ones I know and have used are software SIP clients like
MicroSIP or Zoiper (both really good).

## Database with chosen messaging services

As this solution was prepared to be able to resend messages as faxes or
voice calls, it needs to know what kind of service the recipient has
activated.

For this to work, it needs to have a simple table in a database with
information about chosen service, phone number and Asterisk extension.

There are at least three columns needed:

* Account -> varchar(100) - phone number
* Message -> varchar(1) - character indicating chosen service
* Extension -> varchar(100) - Asterisk extension (e.g. SIP/1000)

`getChanInfo.py` is responsible for gathering this information and relay
it to other scripts. It was prepared to utilize MySQL database (using
MySQL connector). If You need to use other database system, You have to
change it in this script.

## Service indicators

I've defined six indicators for services:

* S - normal SMS operation (SMS Centre)
* F - delivering messages as faxes
* V - delivering messages as a voice synthesis
* C - being simple command service (automated SMS reciver and answerer)
* T - SIP messaging operation
* N - no messaging at all (disable messaging delivery feature for the
      chosen number)

## Dependencies

These tools need some other packages and libraries to work.
Here is the list (hope I remember everything):

1. Asterisk (of course)
2. smsq (should be part of the Asterisk package)
3. pyst2 (Python Asterisk helper; for AGI and AMI)
4. Pillow (PIL)
5. gTTS (Python voice synthesis helper utilizing Google Translate)
6. MySQL Connector for Python (mysql.connector)
7. paps
8. ghostscript (gs)
9. Imagemagick (convert)
10. libtiff-tools (tiffset)
11. FFmpeg (ffmpeg)

## Default (and additional) directories

Default configurations provided here assume that Asterisk and other
tools are in the specific locations.

Here is the list:

1. `/etc/asterisk` - main configuration directory for Asterisk
2. `/etc/asterisk/scripts` - **additional** directory for all scripts
                             from this suite
3. `/var/spool/asterisk` - spool directory for Asterisk
4. `/var/spool/asterisk/sms` - SMS part of Asterisk's spool directory
5. `/var/spool/asterisk/sms/morx` - directory for received SMS-es
6. `/var/spool/asterisk/outgoing` - directory for `.call` files
                                    (originating calls)
7. `/var/spool/T.38` - **additional** directory for faxes (don't have to
                       be T.38 - I've used such name, because T.38 was
                       first way of faxing in Asterisk I used; now I'm
                       using audio stream but the name stayed the
                       same ;))
8. `/var/spool/T.38/outgoing` - **additional** directory for TIFFs to be
                                sent
9. `/var/spool/Voice` - **additional** directory for voice files
10. `/var/spool/Voice/outgoing` - **additional** directory for voice
                                  files to be played on call

Additional above means that those directories didn't exist previously in
the installation. They were created by me to make performing additional
functions easier. They are now **used and necessary** in this software
(`scripts` in the configurations, `T.38` and `Voice` in spool) unless
You decide to place things another way (everything can be configured via
`smsSuiteConfig.py` file).

## Tools, in brief

The main functionality is provided by `extensions.conf` file and
`smsProcess.py` script. Extensions file define all needed extensions and
some basic operations (I've uploaded part of mine describing how to use
my tools) and the Python script processes all SMS-es received by SMS
Centre (also these received before which weren't processed and remains
in the `morx` directory). All other scripts are just tools used by the
main script to get information about channel and chosen service, prepare
other type of message (fax, voice synthesis, etc.) or to post SIP
message, etc.

1. `extensions.conf` - configuration file for Asterisk, which still does
                       main part of the job (it's called
                       `extensions.conf.part` in this repository,
                       because it's only a part here)
2. `smsProcess.py` - main SMS processor/router
3. `getChanInfo.py` - helper for gathering number information (chosen
                      service, channel extension, etc.)
4. `smsToFax.py` - fax page and call creator
5. `smsToVoice.py` - voice synthesis and call creator
6. `smsCommand.py` - SMS commands processor (just an example to be
                     extended to be something better)
7. `cutter.py` - cutting helper for making fax pages shorter
              (from [Mail2Fax](https://github.com/Magnetic-Fox/Mail2Fax)
                 project)
8. `agiGetChanInfo.py` - AGI wrapper for `getChanInfo.py`
9. `agiPostSMS.py` - AGI tool for posting SMS-es like they were received
                     by SMS Centre (for routing SIP messages to SMS)
10. `amiSendSIPIM.py` - AMI tool for sending SIP instant messages (for
                        routing SMS-es to SIP messages)
11. `concatenatedSMSSender.py` - helper for sending concatenated SMS-es
                               (for messages longer than 160 characters)
12. `callFileGenerator.py` - helper for creating call files
13. `tiffTools.py` - helper for text-to-TIFF conversion, resizing and
                     applying resolution information to the TIFF files
         (also from [Mail2Fax](https://github.com/Magnetic-Fox/Mail2Fax)
                     project)
14. `voiceTools.py` - helper for voice synthesis and converting audio
                      files to 8000 Hz WAVE
15. `smsTools.py` - helper for sending SMS-es and gathering data from
                    message files
16. `suiteLogger.py` - project-specific helper for easy warnings and
                       errors logging
17. `smsSuiteConfig.py` - configuration file for all tools
18. `sqlConfig.py` - configuration file for SQL credentials
19. `amiConfig.py` - configuration file for AMI credentials

In fact, only `smsProcess.py`, `agiGetChanInfo.py` and `agiPostSMS.py`
are explicitly seen as used (in `extensions.conf`). Use of other tools
is automated (seen in `smsProcess.py` or other scripts).
